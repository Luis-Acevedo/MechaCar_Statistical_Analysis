## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Using our t-values we can see that vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD capabilities all give us non-random amount of variance when we compare against our mpg. This means as we change these variables on a car they are likely to affect the mpg of the car.

- With such a high p-value we can assume that the slope of our line will not be zero. The p-value is not higher then our significance level further backing up our prediction of variables that affect mpg.

- With an R-squared value of .7149 we can infer that our model will predict a change with 71.49% accuracy.
